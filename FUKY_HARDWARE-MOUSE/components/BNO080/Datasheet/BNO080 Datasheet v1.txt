1 Functional Overview
The BNO080 is manufactured by Bosch Sensortec and runs software provided by Hillcrest Labs. The BNO080
integrates a triaxial 12-bit accelerometer with a range of ±8g, triaxial 16-bit gyroscope with a range of ±2000 
degrees per second, a triaxial geomagnetic sensor, and a 32-bit ARM® Cortex™-M0+ microcontroller. The
sensors are provided by Bosch Sensortec GmbH and the Cortex M0+ processor by Atmel Corporation. 
A system diagram of the BNO080 is shown in Figure 1-1.
Figure 1-1: BNO080 block diagram
At the heart of the BNO080 is Hillcrest’s SH-2 software. The SH-2 software includes MotionEngine™, ‘always-on’ 
features, activity classification and the host interface software. MotionEngine is digital signal processing software 
that takes raw motion data from the MEMS sensors and translates this data into precise motion information. 
These accurate motion outputs can be used for gesture detection and a variety of advanced motion-controlled 
applications. The ‘always-on’ and activity classification features include step counter, stability detector, tap 
detector, and gestures. The host interface module includes sophisticated power management functionality, 
configures sensors, and handles communication with the system host. The SH-2 supports sensor types defined in
Android 4.4 KitKat. Android 5.0 defined additional methods of configuration which the BNO080 supports.
The BNO080 supports the addition of environmental sensors on a secondary I2C interface. See 2.3.
The BNO080 can communicate with the system host over various serial interfaces: SPI, I2C and UART.

1.1 Reference Design Configurations
1.1.1 Standalone Sensor Hub Solution in Mobile Devices
The BNO080 can be integrated as a co-processor in a mobile device such as a smartphone, tablet or ultrabook.
This means the host processor can offload the sensor management and processing functions to the BNO080. 
The BNO080 constantly processes sensor data in the background while the host processor is in sleep state and 
can provide the host processor with real-time sensor data on demand. This low power paradigm is useful to 
enable a number of ‘always-on’ applications such as activity tracking, gesture recognition, fitness and pedestrian 
dead reckoning.
Figure 1-2: BNO080 in a mobile device
1.1.2 Virtual Reality Head Tracker
The BNO080 can be integrated into an HMD as a head tracker to allow the user to be immersed in either a virtual 
reality or an augmented reality application. The BNO080 provides accurate angular position data to allow 
navigation of this virtual world.

1.1.4 Robot Vacuum Cleaner
The BNO080 can be integrated into a robot vacuum cleaner, providing heading information to fuse with cameras 
to allow navigation (SLAM – Simultaneous Localization and Mapping application). The BNO080 can also provide 
details on the tilt of the vacuum and by virtue of the included accelerometer can serve as a bump detector.

1.3 BNO080 Connectivity
The BNO080 can support connections to a host microcontroller through various serial interfaces:
• I
2C interface
• UART interface
• SPI interface
• UART-RVC interface – a simplified UART interface for Robot Vacuum Cleaners
In addition, the BNO080 includes a bootloader to allow for firmware upgrades. The bootloader can support I2C, 
SPI or UART. Access to the bootloader is achieved by setting BOOTN to 0.
Configuration of the communication interface is achieved by setting the protocol selection (PS1/0) pins 
appropriately:

The BNO080 can operate from an internal oscillator, an external 32.768 kHz clock or an external 32.768 kHz 
crystal. If an external clock is used it must be connected to pin 27. Hillcrest recommends a tolerance of 50ppm. If 
a crystal is used it must be connected across pins 26 and 27. Hillcrest recommends using a crystal with tolerance 
50ppm with 22pF capacitor loading.

CLKSEL0 is configured with an internal pulldown at startup. After CLKSEL0 has been sampled, if it is found to be 
a 1, the internal pulldown is disabled to avoid unnecessary power consumption. If either the external or internal 
clock sources are selected then CLKSEL1 is configured as an input with a pulldown. CLSKSEL1 is then sample 
and the clock source determined. After CLKSEL1 has been sampled, if it is found to be a 1, the internal pulldown 
is disabled to avoid unnecessary power consumption.

1.3.2 I
2C interface
The BNO080 supports a standard Fast mode I2C interface and can communicate over this interface at up to 
400kb/s.

Figure 1-11: BNO080 I
2C connection diagram
Figure 1-11 shows how the BNO080 can be connected to an external microcontroller via the I2C interface. The 
following notes are provided as guidelines for connecting the BNO080 in a system design.
1. The H_INTN pin is the application interrupt line that indicates the BNO080 requires attention. This should be 
tied to a GPIO with wake capability. The interrupt is active low.
2. NRST is the reset line for the BNO080 and can be either driven by the application processor or the board 
reset.
3. BOOTN is sampled at reset. If low the BNO080 will enter bootloader mode.
4. Pin 4 (BOOTN) should be pulled high through a 10K Ohms resistor. To use the device firmware update (DFU) 
capability of the BNO080, it is recommended to connect Pin 4 to a GPIO pin on the external microcontroller.
5. Pin 5 (PS1) and Pin 6 (PS0/WAKE) are the host interface protocol selection pins. These pins should be tied to 
ground to select the I2C interface. 
6. Pin 17 (SA0) can be used to select the lower bit of the 7-bit I2C slave device address. 
October 2017 BNO080 Datasheet 1000-3927
www.hillcrestlabs.com © 2017 Hillcrest Laboratories, Inc. All rights reserved. 14 / 57
7. Pullup resistors (R1 and R2) are needed on the I2C communication lines – Pin 19 (HOST_SCL) and Pin 20 
(HOST_SDA). These values may vary depending on the board design and bus capacitance, but typical 
values are between 2KΩ and 4KΩ.
8. The BNO080 supports environmental sensors (e.g. pressure sensors, ambient light sensors) on a secondary 
I
2C interface. This interface should be pulled up via resistors regardless of the presence of the external 
sensor as the SW polls for sensors at reset.
1.3.2.1 I
2C Operation
The I2C specification is documented in [4]. The BNO080 provides a slave interface to the application processor
and supports 100kbps Standard mode (Sm) and 400kbps Fast mode (Fm).
I
2C is a two-wire serial interface that consists of a serial clock line (SCL) and a serial data line (SDA). I2C allows 
for multi-master, multi-slave communication and uses an open-drain architecture to enable this capability. All 
devices that drive the SDA line or SCL line can only drive the line low (‘0’); the bus is released and pulled high by 
the pull-up resistor for ‘1’s. The master device places the slave address on the data bus and the slave device with 
the corresponding address acknowledges the master.
The BNO080 I
2C interface answers to a 7-bit address of either 0x4A or 0x4B:
6 5 4 3 2 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 1 SA0
Figure 1-12: BNO080 I
2C address
The lower address bit of the device address is provided by the SA0 pin. This pin is sampled at reset and should 
be tied to either a logic high or logic low.
1.3.2.2 I
2C Protocol
In general the data line should be stable while the clock is high, data transitions should therefore occur when the 
clock is low. Communication on an I2C bus is initiated with the master device presenting a START command and 
terminated with a STOP command. The bus is busy between the two commands. A START command (or 
condition) is defined as a transition on the SDA signal from high to low while the SCL signal is high (Figure 1-13). 
A STOP command (or condition) is defined as a low to high transition on the SDA signal while the SCL signal is

endian format – least-significant byte first. The master device generates the clock. Every byte transmitted must be 
acknowledged. An acknowledgement is generated by the device receiving the data and is formed by the receiver 
driving the SDA line low during the ninth bit. 
The master device generally drives the clock. However, if the slave device requires additional time to respond it 
can force the clock low, only releasing the line when it is prepared to deliver more data. The master device MUST 
support clock stretching.
The first byte presented after the start condition contains the device address and the read/write bit. The least￾significant bit (LSB) of this first byte is the read/write indication (‘0’ corresponding to write)
Figure 1-15: Device addressing
For a write cycle data is provided after the device address. The slave (BNO080 in this instance) provides an ACK 
for every byte received. A typical I2C write cycle is provided below (S=start, P=stop, AD=Address).
Figure 1-16: I2C write cycle
A read cycle requires that the device must first be selected with its device address. Following the device address 
the BNO080 will provide data. Every byte should be acknowledged by the master:

The BNO080 uses Hillcrest’s SHTP (Sensor Hub Transport Protocol) protocol to communicate. The BNO080 
application does not support the repeated start method for typical I2C register based interfaces. More details are 
available in [2].

Figure 1-18: BNO080 UART-SHTP connection diagram
Figure 1-18 shows how the BNO080 can be connected to an external microcontroller via a UART interface. The 
following notes are provided as guidelines for connecting the BNO080 in a system design.
1. The H_INTN pin is driven low prior to the initial byte of UART transmission. It will deassert and reassert 
between messages. It is used by the host to timestamp the beginning of data transmission.
2. NRST is the reset line for the BNO080 and can be either driven by the application processor or the board 
reset.
3. BOOTN is sampled at reset. If low the BNO080 will enter bootloader mode.
4. Pin 4 (BOOTN) should be pulled high through a 10K Ohms resistor. To use the device firmware update (DFU) 
capability of the BNO080, it is recommended to connect Pin 4 to a GPIO pin on the external microcontroller.
5. Pin 5 (PS1) and Pin 6 (PS0/WAKE) are the host interface protocol selection pins. These pins should be tied to 
VDDIO and ground respectively to select the UART-SHTP interface.

6. The BNO080 supports environmental sensors (e.g. pressure sensors, ambient light sensors) on a secondary 
I
2C interface. This interface should be pulled up via resistors regardless of the presence of the external 
sensor as the SW polls for sensors at reset.
1.3.3.1 UART operation
The UART is configured for 3Mkb/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit and no parity. The UART protocol relies on an idle line 
being ‘high’. A transmission is started with the assertion of a start bit (pulling the line low), followed by the data, 
LSB first. After the data segment is sent (in this case 8-bits), the line is pulled high (the stop signal) for a minimum 
number of bits (1 for the BNO080) to indicate end of that segment. Bytes sent from the host to the BNO080 must 
be separated by at least 100us. Bytes sent from the BNO to the host have no extra spacing.
Figure 1-19: UART signaling
The BNO080 uses Hillcrest’s SHTP protocol to communicate. The UART protocol makes use of framing bytes at 
the start and end of transmission. More details are available in [2].
1.3.4 SPI Interface
The BNO080 supports 4-wire Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) for host communication. A typical connection 
diagram is provided in Figure 1-20.

Figure 1-20: BNO080 SPI connection diagram
Figure 1-20 shows how the BNO080 can be connected to an external microcontroller via a SPI interface. The 
following notes are provided as guidelines for connecting the BNO080 in a system design.
1. The H_INTN pin is the application interrupt line that indicates the BNO080 requires attention. This should be 
tied to a GPIO with wake capability. The interrupt is active low.
2. NRST is the reset line for the BNO080 and can be either driven by the application processor or the board 
reset.
3. BOOTN is sampled at reset. If low the BNO080 will enter bootloader mode.
4. Pin 4 (BOOTN) should be pulled high through a 10K Ohms resistor. To use the device firmware update (DFU) 
capability of the BNO080, it is recommended to connect Pin 4 to a GPIO pin on the external microcontroller.
5. Pin 5 (PS1) and Pin 6 (PS0/WAKE) are the host interface protocol selection pins. Both pins must be high from 
before reset until after the first assertion of H_INTN to select the SPI interface. Pin 5 may be tied to VDDIO. 
Pin 6 must be connected to a GPIO so that the WAKE functionality can be performed.
October 2017 BNO080 Datasheet 1000-3927

6. After reset the PS0/WAKE signal is used as a ‘wake’ signal taking the BNO080 out of sleep if the host wants 
to initiate communication with the BNO080.
7. The BNO080 supports environmental sensors (e.g. pressure sensors, ambient light sensors) on a secondary 
I
2C interface. This interface should be pulled up via resistors regardless of the presence of the external 
sensor as the SW polls for sensors at reset.
1.3.4.1 SPI Operation
SPI is a 4-wire synchronous serial protocol. SPI provides a full duplex communication path and has a 
master/slave relationship. The master provides the clock for all transactions. Multiple slave devices can exist on a 
SPI interface by the use of a chip select signal. The BNO080 is the slave in all communications.
SPI allows for two clock polarities and clock edge sampling. These options are typically called CPOL and CPHA. 
The BNO080 uses CPOL = 1 and CPHA = 1. In this configuration the clock idles high and data is captured on the 
rising edge of the clock:
Figure 1-21: BNO080 SPI signaling
SPI transmits data MSB first and is byte oriented (i.e. all data is passed in 8-bit segments). Any number of bytes 
can be transferred in a single transaction (chip select assertion). 
MISO is the data transferred from the slave to the master and MOSI from master to slave.
The BNO080 uses Hillcrest’s SHTP protocol to communicate. More details are available at [2].
1.3.4.2 Wake operation
When the host want to initiate contact with the BNO080 it may be necessary to wake the processor from a sleep 
mode. To enable this function the BNO080 uses the PS0/wake pin. The pin is active low and should be driven low 
to initiate the wake procedure. The BNO080 will respond by asserting the interrupt line at which point the host can 
initiate SPI accesses. The BNO080 will de-assert the interrupt line as soon as the chip select is detected.
Figure 1-22: SPI Wake operation
1.3.5 UART-RVC interface
The BNO080 provides a simplified UART interface for use on robot vacuum cleaners (RVC). When configured in 
this mode the BNO080 simply transmits heading and sensor information at 100Hz over the UART TX pin. A 
typical connection is shown in Figure 1-23

1.3.5.1 UART-RVC operation
The UART operates at 115200 b/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit and no parity. The UART protocol relies on an idle line 
being ‘high’. A transmission is started with the assertion of a start bit (pulling the line low), followed by the data, 
LSB first. After the data segment is sent (in this case 8-bits), the line is pulled high (the stop signal) for a minimum

The 19-byte message has the following fields:
Header: Each report is prefixed with a 0xAAAA header
Index: A monotonically increasing 8-bit count is provided (0-255) per report
Yaw: The yaw is a measure of the rotation around the Z-axis since reset. The yaw has a range of +/- 180˚ and is 
provided in 0.01˚ increments, i.e. a report of 8734 is equivalent to 87.34˚.
Pitch: The pitch is a measure of the rotation around the Y-axis. The pitch has a range of +/- 90˚ and is provided in 
0.01˚ increments, i.e. a report of 1072 is equivalent to 10.72˚.

Reserved: The message is terminated with three reserved bytes, currently set to zero
Checksum (Csum): The Index, yaw, pitch, roll, acceleration and reserved data bytes are added to produce the 
checksum.
To determine the actual orientation of the module, the rotations should be applied in the order yaw, pitch then roll.

1.4 Host Communication
1.4.1 SHTP
The BNO080 uses Hillcrest’s SHTP (Sensor Hub Transport Protocol) to communicate for all interface styles 
except UART-RVC. SHTP provides a means of passing data between the BNO080 and a host with support for 
multiple channels. The BNO080 does not currently support the inclusion of 3rd party applications, but the SHTP 
protocol allows for separation of traffic via these channels such that applications on a host can communicate over 
this channel.
All data is prefixed with a 4-byte header:
Start Stop D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0

Byte Field

Figure 1-26: SHTP Header
Length Bit 15 of the length field is used to indicate if a transfer is a continuation 
of a previous transfer. Bits 14:0 are used to indicate the total number of 
bytes in the cargo plus header, which may be spread over multiple 
messages. The bytes in the header field are counted as part of the 
length. A length of 65535 (0xFFFF) is reserved because a failed 
peripheral can too easily produce 0xFFFF. Therefore, the largest cargo 
that can be transported is 32766 minus the header bytes. The BNO080 
does not support receiving fragmented messages but it does support 
sending them.
Channel The channel number of the cargo. Channel 0 is the command channel 
and is used by the SHTP.
SeqNum The sequence number of the cargo. The sequence number is a 
monotonically incrementing number that increments once for each 
cargo sent or cargo continuation sent. Each channel and each direction 
has its own sequence number. The sequence number is used to detect 
duplicate or missing cargoes and to associate segmented cargoes with 
each other.
The length field allows a host to schedule the correct number of clocks to generate for reads over I2C and SPI. 
The BNO080 supports partial reads if the host cannot accept all the bytes in one read, the length will be updated 
on a subsequent read. So, for instance a host could read the first 4 bytes to determine the number of clocks to 
generate and then repeat the read with the required number of clocks. The protocol is fully described in [2].
The BNO080 supports 6 channels:
• Channel 0: the SHTP command channel
• Channel 1: executable
• Channel 2: sensor hub control channel
• Channel 3: input sensor reports (non-wake, not gyroRV)
• Channel 4: wake input sensor reports (for sensors configured as wake up sensors)
• Channel 5: gyro rotation vector
The SHTP control channel provides information about the applications built into the BNO080 firmware image. The 
BNO080 uses advertisements to publish the channel maps and the names of the built-in applications.
The executable channel allows the host to reset the BNO080 and provide details of its operating mode. Figure 
1-27 provides details.

The use of the ‘on’ and ‘sleep’ commands provides support when the host is entering and exiting sleep. When the 
‘sleep’ command is issued all sensors that are configured as always on or wake (see 1.4.5.1) will continue to 
operate all, other sensors will be disabled. All configured sensors will be enabled when the host issues the ’on’ 
command.
The sensor hub control channel is used to configure the BNO080. Responses from the BNO080 in reaction to 
configuration requests are also sent over this channel.
The input sensor report channel is unidirectional, passing data from the BNO080 to the host. All input reports 
pass over this channel except for sensors that are configured as wake sensors and the gyro rotation vector. A 
wake sensor is defined in Android as a sensor that will remain awake during periods when a mobile device is 
asleep and can wake the processor when a particular event occurs (the event being defined by the sensor).
The wake input sensor report channel is used for sensors that are configured as wake sensors.
The gyro rotation vector is a channel used for the gyro rotation vector. A separate channel is provided to allow 
applications on a host processor to prioritize this data over others to ensure low latency.
1.4.2 Report Structure
The BNO080 runs Hillcrest’s SH2 protocol. Full details are available in [1].
All commands, responses, sensor input reports are prefixed with a report number. The report number follows the 
SHTP header.
For example, the command to read the Product ID is:

1.4.3 BNO080 Configuration
Motion analysis systems must process data from sensors that can be mounted in an arbitrary manner and in 
systems with characteristics that affect the way the data is delivered. For example a tap detector could behave 
differently in a small form factor device made of metal than a tap detector in a larger form factor device made of 
plastic. Another example is the static calibration record. This record provides a description of the sensor and its 
orientation; necessary details to provide calibration of the sensor data. 
The BNO080 contains a Flash Record System (FRS) to store these configurations. 
Complete documentation of these records is provided in [1]. Supported FRS records in the BNO080 are:

Figure 1-31: FRS records
FRS records are written by use of FRS read and write requests. Writing and reading FRS records follows a multi￾step protocol. 
For writes an FRS Write Request is issued indicating which FRS record to write and the amount of data to be 
written. The BNO080 will respond with a write response acknowledging the request. The host will then issue a 
number of FRS Write Data packets to which the BNO080 will respond. The final response from the BNO080 will 
indicate a successful conclusion to the flash writes or if the process failed a failure indication.
An FRS read follows a similar pattern. An FRS Read request is issued and FRS Read responses provide the data 
with the final response indicating completion of the record retrieval.
1.4.4 Sensor Metadata
The BNO080 operates as a sensor hub and as such provides processing of sensor data. In order for a user to
understand the capabilities of the sensors, metadata is provided that describes those capabilities. The SH-2 
reference manual provides full details of the metadata record but as an example Figure 1-32 provides the 
metadata for the rotation vector. Metadata is stored as an FRS record and is therefore retrieved as an FRS read.

1.4.5 Sensor Reports
Sensors are enabled by the host issuing a Set Feature command, the feature report ID being for the sensor of 
interest. The Set Feature command provides the parameters necessary for the sensor to be enabled. Typically 
this is just the sampling period (report interval), but some sensors require additional configuration. A sensor can 
be configured to only issue reports when a change in the sensor value occurs (change sensitivity), this can be 
absolute or relative. An absolute change is a change from below to above a certain value, while relative is a 
change between two consecutive samples. Google introduced the concept of batching which is supported by the 
BNO080 with a batch interval field.

Figure 1-33: Set Feature command
The host can request a feature report for a particular sensor (Get Feature command) to which the BNO080 will 
respond with a Get Feature Response. This can be used to verify the configuration of a sensor. A Get Feature 
Response is also issued by the BNO080 whenever the sensor’s operating mode changes which can occur due to 
the host issuing a Set Feature command or because the internal rates changed due to events within the BNO080.
1.4.5.1 Batching
Batching is a power management feature added to Android Lollipop. The concept is that the application processor 
receives data in batches hence avoiding the constant processing of sensor data. This delay in processing allows 
the processor to do more useful work until sufficient sensor data has accumulated for the task for which the 
sensor data was requested. In addition when the application processor sleeps, sensor data can accumulate in a 
batch buffer and be used to wake the processor when sufficient data has accumulated.
To facilitate the batching the BNO080 provides two batch queues. The higher priority queue is for wake sensors 
and the other for all remaining enabled sensors (described as always-on in [1]). The batch interval in the set 
feature command indicates how many microseconds must pass before the batch is sent to the host. If the 
application processor is asleep it will be woken when the wake queue reaches the programmed interval. At that 
point all data from both queues will be pushed to the host. Data in the non-wake queue will be allowed to be lost, 
oldest data first in the event the application processor is sleeping. A sensor is designated as a wake sensor by a 
flag in the feature flags field.
Note that the BNO080 only supports one batch queue per type of sensor. If a sensor is configured as a wake 
sensor it cannot also be marked as a non-wake sensor (always-on).

Figure 1-34: Calibrated gyroscope input report
The sequence number is a monotonically increasing value that is used to check for dropped samples.
The status byte is broken into two fields:
Bits 1:0 – indicate the status of a sensor.
0 – Unreliable
1 – Accuracy low
2 – Accuracy medium
3 – Accuracy high
Bits 7:2 - Delay upper bits: 6 most-significant bits of report delay
The delay byte is the lower 8 bits of the report delay. Delay has a resolution of 100µs.
Bytes 4-9 of the report provide the gyroscope data.
1.4.5.3 Timestamping
The sensor report delay field allows an accurate timestamp to be formed in the host application. Delay measures 
the time delta from the sensor interrupt to the timebase reference. By generating a timestamp on the host 
interrupt signal the host application can then determine an accurate sensor timestamp by subtracting delay.
Note that the BNO080 also provides a timebase reference report with sensor reports:
Byte Description
0 Report ID=0xFB
1 Base Delta LSB: relative to transport-defined reference 
point. Signed. Units are 100 microsecond ticks.
2 Base Delta 
3 Base Delta 
4 Base Delta MSB
Figure 1-35: Timebase Reference Report
The timebase reference functions in the same way as the delay field in the sensor report. The base delta should 
be subtracted from the timestamp registered on the host for the host interrupt signal. When the timebase 
reference report is provided the individual sensor report will likely have a delay of zero. However, in cases where 
sensor reports are concatenated (due to delays in processing), the delay field may be populated, in which case 
both that delay and the timebase reference should be taken into account when calculating the actual timestamp of 
the sensor sample.
As an example, if the host receives the following report:
Figure 1-36: Timestamping example
The host will create a timestamp based on the assertion of HINT (call it T). The timebase reference provides a 
baseline reference of 120 * 100µs or 12ms. All sensor reports are thus timestamped as T-12ms + their own delay.

In this example, the first sensor report should be timestamped as occurring at T-12ms and the second at T –
10.3ms (T - 12ms + 1.7ms).
1.5 Bootloader
The BNO080 provides a bootloader function to allow firmware upgrades to be applied. During reset or power-on 
sequence, the bootloader first checks the status of the BOOTN pin. If the pin is pulled low during reset or power￾on, the BNO080 will enter the bootloader mode. If the BOOTN pin is pulled high, then the bootloader starts the 
application.
The bootloader uses the host interface as configured by the PS0/1 pins (see Figure 1-5). If I
2C is selected the 
bootloader has an I2C address of either 0x28 or 0x29 (SA0 provides the lowest address bit). 
After the BNO080 enters the bootloader mode, it waits for the size of the application code from the host. The 
application to be written to flash is split into a number of frames. The application in flash is updated by writing 
these frames to the BNO080 and reading a status back to verify the write was successful. 
Reference code (on the host microcontroller) for using the bootloader to perform Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU)
is available upon request.

2 Sensor Data Processing
The BNO080 analyzes the data from the 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis magnetometer. It 
manages the various sensors, reads data, and provides a number of outputs to the host. The BNO080 processes 
motion relative to a frame of reference. It has no knowledge of the orientation of sensors within the device and 
must be configured to conform to the desired frame of reference of the device. While the BNO080 is not 
necessarily used within Android systems, the frame of reference defined in the Android specification is used by 
the BNO080 software. In Android, the device frame of reference is represented as X axis horizontal, positive to 
the right, Y axis vertical, positive along the face of the device and Z axis positive towards the outside of the front 
face of the device. The frame of reference is shown in Figure 2-1. 
Figure 2-1: Android co-ordinate system
The BNO080 can be mounted within the device in any orientation that allows the PCB to be laid out efficiently. 
The BNO080 sensor orientation is provided in Figure 4-1. 
The BNO080 needs to be configured to understand what the orientation is relative to the device frame of 
reference. This is achieved by modifying either the static calibration record if the device is passed through a 
calibration step or by modifying the sensor orientation records. Sensor orientation is discussed further in section
4.
2.1 Motion Outputs
Motion outputs allow applications to understand the motion being applied to the device as measured by BNO080.
2.1.1 Acceleration Outputs
The 3-axis accelerometer measures the acceleration of the device (note that the accelerometer will measure 
gravity as acceleration). BNO080 calibrates the accelerometer output to improve the data reported. BNO080 will 
report this acceleration aligned to the coordinate frame of the device. BNO080 can (after fusing data with the 
gyroscope) separate gravity from this acceleration, thus providing the BNO080 with the following acceleration 
outputs:
• Calibrated Acceleration (m/s2
). Acceleration of the device including gravity
• Linear acceleration (m/s2
). Acceleration of the device with gravity removed
• Gravity (m/s2
)
• Raw uncalibrated accelerometer data (ADC units). Used for testing
Note that for raw data to be transmitted the accelerometer must be enabled by a separate set feature request, i.e. 
the raw sensor listens to an already configured sensor. The rate specified in the raw sensor set feature request 
cannot be higher than the underlying sensor configuration. The raw data will either be delivered at the same rate 
as the underlying sensor or at the rate requested (within the constraints of rate decimation).

2.1.2 Angular Velocity Outputs
The 3-axis gyroscope measures the angular velocity of the device. The angular velocity is reported as rotations 
around the X, Y, Z axes as depicted in Figure 2-1. A positive value is reported for counter-clockwise rotations. 
BNO080 calibrates this data to improve the measurement and provides the following outputs:
• Calibrated gyroscope (rad/s). The angular velocity of the device
• Uncalibrated gyroscope (rad/s). Angular velocity without bias compensation. This output is required for 
Android 4.4 compatibility. The bias is reported as a second parameter
• Raw uncalibrated gyroscope (ADC units). Data direct from the gyroscope, used for testing
Note that for raw data to be transmitted the gyroscope must be enabled by a separate set feature request, i.e. the 
raw sensor listens to an already configured sensor. The rate specified in the raw sensor set feature request 
cannot be higher than the underlying sensor configuration. The raw data will either be delivered at the same rate 
as the underlying sensor or at the rate requested (within the constraints of rate decimation).
2.1.3 Magnetometer Processing
While not actually a motion sensor, the magnetometer can be used to detect motion. The magnetometer 
measures the surrounding magnetic field and is used to determine absolute orientation as well as support other 
fusion operations. Absolute orientation can be thought of as determining which direction is magnetic north and 
evaluating the sensors orientation with respect to north. 
The complication with measuring the magnetic field is that the field is distorted by the proximity of ferrous or 
magnetic material. The distortion caused by these materials is often referred to as the soft-iron and hard-iron 
effect. To remove this distortion the device must be moved sufficiently through all 3 axes (X, Y and Z) of 3-
dimensional space. An indication of the degree of calibration is reported in the magnetometer reports accuracy 
field.
BNO080 provides the following magnetic field measurement outputs:
• Magnetic field calibrated (in µTesla). The fully calibrated magnetic field measurement.
• Magnetic field uncalibrated (in µTesla). The magnetic field measurement without hard-iron offset applied, 
the hard-iron estimate is provided as a separate parameter.
• Raw magnetic field measurement (in ADC units). Direct data from the magnetometer. Used for testing.
2.2 Orientation Outputs
One of the primary outputs of BNO080 is an estimation of the device orientation. Fusing data from 
accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers has a rich history of usage for estimating orientation. BNO080
provides multiple estimates that have different tradeoffs as described below (note that the term rotation vector
used below is derived from Google’s definition in Android 4.4).
2.2.1 Geomagnetic Rotation Vector
The geomagnetic rotation vector is an orientation output that is expressed as a quaternion referenced to magnetic 
north and gravity. It is produced by fusing the outputs of the accelerometer and magnetometer. The gyroscope is 
specifically excluded in order to produce a rotation vector output using less power than is required to produce the 
rotation vector of section 2.2.4. The consequences of removing the gyroscope are:
• Less responsive output since the highly dynamic outputs of the gyroscope are not used
• More errors in the presence of varying magnetic fields
2.2.2 Game Rotation Vector
The game rotation vector is an orientation output that is expressed as a quaternion with no specific reference for 
heading, while roll and pitch are referenced against gravity. It is produced by fusing the outputs of the 
accelerometer and the gyroscope (i.e. no magnetometer). The game rotation vector does not use the 
magnetometer to correct the gyroscopes drift in yaw. This is a deliberate omission (as specified by Google) to 
allow gaming applications to use a smoother representation of the orientation without the jumps that an 
instantaneous correction provided by a magnetic field update could provide. Long term the output will likely drift in 
October 2017 BNO080 Datasheet 1000-3927
www.hillcrestlabs.com © 2017 Hillcrest Laboratories, Inc. All rights reserved. 32 / 57
yaw due to the characteristics of gyroscopes, but this is seen as preferable for this output versus a corrected 
output.
2.2.3 AR/VR Stabilized Game Rotation vector
While the magnetometer is removed from the calculation of the game rotation vector, the accelerometer itself can 
create a potential correction in the rotation vector produced (i.e. the estimate of gravity changes). For applications 
(typically augmented or virtual reality applications) where a sudden jump can be disturbing, the output is adjusted 
to prevent these jumps in a manner that takes account of the velocity of the sensor system. This process is called 
AR/VR stabilization. An FRS (Flash Record System – see Figure 1-31) record is provided to allow configuration of 
this feature. 
2.2.4 Rotation Vector
The rotation vector provides an orientation output that is expressed as a quaternion referenced to magnetic north 
and gravity. It is produced by fusing the outputs of the accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. The rotation 
vector is the most accurate orientation estimate available. The magnetometer provides correction in yaw to 
reduce drift and the gyroscope enables the most responsive performance.
2.2.5 AR/VR Stabilized Rotation Vector
Estimates of the magnetic field and the roll/pitch of the device can create a potential correction in the rotation 
vector produced. For applications (typically augmented or virtual reality applications) where a sudden jump can be 
disturbing, the output is adjusted to prevent these jumps in a manner that takes account of the velocity of the 
sensor system. This process is called AR/VR stabilization. An FRS (Flash Record System – see Figure 1-31) 
record is provided to allow configuration of this feature.
2.2.6 Gyro rotation Vector
Head tracking systems within a virtual reality headset require low latency processing of motion. To facilitate this, 
the BNO080 can provide a rotation vector at rates up to 1kHz. The gyro rotation Vector provides an alternate 
orientation to the standard rotation vector. Compared to the standard rotation vector the gyro rotation vector has 
an optimized processing path and correction style (correction is the adjustments made to the output based on 
more accurate estimates of gravity, mag field, angular velocity) that is suitable for head tracking applications. 
By default the Gyro rotation vector provides an orientation output that is expressed as a quaternion. It can be 
configured via FRS record to be based on either the rotation vector (using the magnetometer) or the game 
rotation vector (ignoring the magnetometer).
2.2.7 Gyro rotation Vector Prediction
In virtual reality systems reducing latency is a vital requirement to proving an immersive experience. The gyro 
rotation vector provides a low latency output. However in a system there are many factors that can add to the 
latency budget:
• IMU processing
• Data path between IMU and video rendering
• Video rendering
• Video buffer/display write
To aid in the reduction of the overall system latency the BNO080 can derive an expected orientation for some 
time in the future. Predicting 20-30 ms into the future can significantly improve the perception of reality within the 
virtual reality world. The predictor accepts the gyro rotation vector as input and produces a second rotation vector 
for some time in the future. An FRS record is used to tune the predictor for the type of motion. The predictor 
accepts three constants (alpha, beta, gamma) for the tuning. 
The default prediction time is 28ms and is determined for motion typical of a head tracker. Some typical 
parameters that can be used are captured in Figure 2-2. These values are all for motion typical of a head tracker.

2.3 Environmental Sensors
The BNO080 provides support for environmental sensors connected over an I2C interface (separate to the host 
interface). Currently the BNO080 supports:
• Bosch Sensortec BME280 pressure/humidity/temperature sensor
• Bosch Sensortec BMP280 pressure/temperature sensor (only BMP280 or BME280 should be populated)
• Capella Microsystems CM36686 proximity and ambient light sensor
If the sensors are not required for a particular application the I2C bus should be correctly terminated with pullup 
resistors as the BNO080 attempts to discover the sensors at reset. Proper termination will ensure correct 
behavior of the BNO080.
The ALS and proximity sensors typically require calibration as these sensors are typically placed behind glass or 
plastic. Contact Hillcrest Labs for details.
2.4 Classification System
With the proliferation of sensors available within mobile devices, there is an increasing interest in providing value 
by understanding the context of the device or device holder. Classifying the context based on the sensors 
available is an active area of research with an emphasis of the classifiers being ‘always on’, so low power is an 
inherent requirement. BNO080 supports a number of classifiers that generate events upon detection of a 
particular context or motion.
2.4.1 Stability Detection and Classification
Analysis of the motion sensors allows BNO080 to classify stability. BNO080 provides two virtual sensors to 
quantify stability: a stability detector and a stability classifier.
The stability classifier uses both the accelerometer and gyroscope to distinguish between three levels of stability:
• On table: the device is likely on a table or other stable surface
• Stable: the device is likely being held, but held in a stationary manner
• Motion: the device or device holder is in motion
The stability detector uses the accelerometer to distinguish between stability and motion.
Both the classifier and detector have configurable thresholds for the levels of stability. These thresholds are 
stored as FRS records as described in the SH-2 Reference Manual [1].
The stability detector has an acceleration threshold which is the aggregate acceleration of the device. The default 
value is 0.784m/s2
. The stability detector also includes a time threshold. The acceleration of the device must stay 
below the threshold set for the duration of the time record to register as stable. The default value is 500ms.
October 2017 BNO080 Datasheet 1000-3927
www.hillcrestlabs.com © 2017 Hillcrest Laboratories, Inc. All rights reserved. 34 / 57
The FRS record that configures the stability classifier is encoded in the MotionEngine power management and 
stability classifier FRS record. The FRS record provides a stable threshold and a duration threshold. The data 
from the gyroscope must be below the stable threshold for the duration threshold period for Stable to be declared.
The default values are 1 rad/s and 3s respectively. The static calibration record for the device contains 
parameters that describe the noise floor of the gyroscope. Comparison of the gyroscope’s output to the expected 
noise of the system allows for a very reliable measure of high stability, such as one might see when the device is 
on a table.
Note that the stability detector is lower power than the stability classifier due to the sensors used (accelerometers 
currently consume less power than gyroscopes).
2.4.2 Tap Detector
The tap detector evaluates data from the accelerometer and generates an event when either a single or double 
tap is detected. The output of the tap detector indicates the axis along which the tap was detected and whether 
the tap was a single or a double tap. The axes are aligned to the Android frame of reference (Figure 2-1).
Figure 2-3: Tap detector
2.4.3 Step Detector
The step detector uses data from the accelerometer to detect steps. It will output a value of 1.0 whenever a step 
is detected. The step detector has two optimizations, one for wrist worn devices and the second for all other use 
cases.
The step detector has built in defaults (listed below). Modification of these values, while not recommended, is 
possible. Consultation with Hillcrest is advised.
Configurable options:
• watchSelector: 1 for wrist worn devices, 0 otherwise
• allowTime: max variation of step period. Default value 250ms
• stepMinTime: minimum step period. Default value 300ms
• groupDelay: group delay of the filter. Filtering of accelerometer data is required to ensure accurate 
detection of steps, particularly if the accelerometer is rotating with respect to gravity. The group delay of 
the filter is a compromise between responsiveness and error accumulation. A value of 90ms is used and 
the user is discouraged from modifying this value without consultation with Hillcrest.
• threshold: vertical motion threshold. The threshold in meters below which a step would not be recognized. 
Default is 3.1mm
• thresholdWatch: A second threshold used for wrist worn devices. The default value is 0.01
• thresholdNonWatch: A second threshold for devices other than wrist worn. The default value is 1.2x10-4
October 2017 BNO080 Datasheet 1000-3927

2.4.4 Step Counter
The step counter uses the step detector to detect and count steps. It provides a more accurate indication of steps 
taken than the step detector. It provides increased accuracy by evaluating the data around each step event, 
possibly reclassifying previous samples as either steps or non-steps, depending upon the patterns perceived. It 
outputs a 16-bit step count. The application processor maintains a 64-bit count of the total number of steps taken 
and must therefore manage any roll-overs in the step counter output. The step counter will assert the host 
interrupt while the host processor is asleep if the 16-bit step counter is close to overflow to ensure steps are not 
lost. 
The step counter has two optimizations, one for wrist worn devices and the second for all other use cases.
2.4.5 Activity Classification
The activity classifier uses the accelerometer to determine if the user is walking, running or climbing stairs. The 
climbing stairs feature requires the use of an external pressure sensor. The sensor is configurable to allow 
customization for a particular device and/or a particular individual. The configurable options relate to the step rate 
for running versus walking and to the variation of the signal strength of the accelerometer.
The configurable options are:
Thresholds related to Step Rates
• runLowerThldStep: The lowest step rate for running. The default is 1.25 steps/s
• walkUpperThldStep: The highest step rate for walking. The default is 2.25 steps/s
• walkLowerThldStep: The lowest step rate for walking. The default is 0.75 step/s
Thresholds related to Step Signal Variation Strength:
• runUpperThldStd: The highest signal variation strength for running. The default is 23.50m/s2
• runLowerThldStd: The lowest signal variation strength for running. The default is 3.20m2/s2
• walkUpperThldStd: The highest signal variation strength for walking. The default is 4.50m2/s2
• walkLowerThldStd: The lowest signal variation strength for running. The default is 0.75m2/s2
The classification considers steps within a 4s window and the variation in signal strength is determined by taking 
the standard deviation of the accelerometer normal over the 4s window.
With the default settings a classification matrix as depicted in Figure 2-4 can be created.

2.4.6 Significant Motion Detector
The significant motion detector was introduced by Google in Android 4.3 (API level 18). The definition is that an 
event should be raised when a user has created motion that implies they have changed location. The typical use￾case is that the sensor be low power (as it can run while the phone is asleep) and that it alerts the main 
processing element of the device when a change in location is likely. BNO080 uses the step detector and 
processing based on the accelerometer to determine if the user has created significant motion. The detector 
outputs a value of 1.0 when an event occurs. Per the Android specification this detector will disable itself 
immediately after the event is output.
Configuration of the significant motion detector requires configuration of the following two parameters:
• Significant motion step threshold. The number of steps required to trigger the event. The default value is 
5 steps.
• Acceleration threshold. A threshold loosely based on the device’s acceleration to trigger significant motion 
processing. Default value is 10m/s2
2.4.7 Shake Detector
The shake detector determines if the device has been shaken. It can be used as a wake-up sensor or for UI 
interaction. It has a number of configurable options:
• Magnitude of acceleration that must be exceeded. Default 8m/s2
• Number of direction changes to qualify as a shake and the axis of interest. Default of 3
• Minimum and maximum time between direction changes. Default: 50ms < time < 400ms
• Which device axis to detect shake along (X, Y or Z). Default: all axes.
The configuration parameters are stored in the shake detector configuration FRS record.

3 Calibration and Interpretation
The BNO080 interprets the data from its sensors to model the device’s motion and ultimately determine the 
device’s orientation and classify the motion of the device. The accuracy of this model is dependent on the quality 
of the data provided by the sensors. 
All sensors exhibit slight imperfections. These imperfections generally appear as errors in offset and scale. 
Sensor systems that contain three axes have an additional variant of offset that includes skew and rotation (skew 
is the non-orthogonality of the three axes and rotation is the angular difference of the coordinate frame of the 
sensor to the coordinate frame of the device). Calibration of the sensor data falls into two categories:
• Static calibration
• Dynamic calibration
Static calibration is the correction of non-varying parameters to the data returned from the sensors. These static 
adjustments to the data typically compensate for offsets and scaling errors that do not vary over time or with 
temperature. Examples (this list is not exhaustive) of non-varying errors (or errors that are not compensated for 
dynamically) are:
• Accelerometer (or gyroscope or magnetometer) skew (also called cross-axis sensitivity)
• Accelerometer (or gyroscope or magnetometer) gain or sensitivity
• Sensor orientation with respect to device frame of reference
A static calibration data record (SCD) is essentially a description of the sensor system used on the device and 
from that record the BNO080 calibrates and interprets the data from the sensors producing data in the appropriate 
SI units for use by applications. The SCD record can be generic and essentially describe the sensors as per the 
datasheet, or the record can be specific to the actual sensors in the package. 
A calibration record derived from the specific sensors populated on the device is a more accurate description of 
the actual sensors used and will hence yield a more accurate model of the device’s motion. Hillcrest provides a 
calibration system (CTS3) that when used in the production facility with suitable motion inducing equipment can 
evaluate the individual sensors on the device and build the appropriate SCD record for that device. More details 
on CTS3 are available on request.
Dynamic calibration is the correction to the data returned from the sensors that varies with either time or 
temperature. The BNO080 calculates what the adjustment should be during use of the sensor and applies 
correction factors as necessary in real time. Examples of dynamic calibration parameters are:
• Gyroscope zero-rate offset
• Accelerometer zero-g offset
In addition as the BNO080 has applications in devices such as Robot Vacuum Cleaners it is necessary to 
calibrate the accelerometer in a planar fashion (i.e. around the axis that the vacuum cleaner revolves). Selection 
of 3D or planar accelerometer calibration is via command.
Magnetic field calibration is an additional capability of the BNO080. The primary goal of using the magnetometer 
is to measure the Earth’s magnetic field. The magnetic field measured by a magnetometer is distorted by the 
presence of ferrous and magnetic material in the near vicinity. These distortions are referred to as soft and hard 
iron effects respectively. The offset and distortion to the measured magnetic field is estimated and compensated 
for continuously while the device is in motion. Removal of the distortions allows for an improved estimate of the 
Earth’s magnetic field. 
3.1 Calibration Effects
This section provides a brief overview of the benefits of dynamic calibration and the recommended settings for 
various applications.

3.1.1 Calibration Command
The SH-2 firmware in the BNO080 allows a host microcontroller to enable or disable the dynamic calibration of 
the accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. Refer to the SH-2 Reference Manual [1] for the command used 
to control calibration of each sensor. The command allows the host to control when calibration is performed. Note 
that the calibration settings do not persist across resets of the BNO080.
3.1.2 Accelerometer
Dynamic calibration for an accelerometer is the removal of zero-g offset (ZGO). An accelerometer at rest should 
only report gravity, any deviation is the zero-g offset. This is most easily seen when the accelerometer is placed 
with one axis perpendicular to the Earth, the other two axes should report zero. ZGO errors can manifest as tilts 
or tilt corrections (e.g. the screen on a head mounted display may be tilted with respect to the expected horizon) 
and this usually indicates that the accelerometer needs to be calibrated. The BNO80 provides two methods of 
calibrating the accelerometer ZGO; a full 3-dimensional approach for devices that can move in freely in space and 
a planar calibration for devices that are constrained to move in a plane (such as a robot vacuum cleaner). For 
more information on calibrating the accelerometer, see section 3.2. 
3.1.3 Gyroscope
Dynamic calibration for a gyroscope is the removal of zero rate offset (ZRO). A gyroscope at rest should report 
zero rad/s on all axes. Any deviation from zero is the zero rate offset (ZRO). ZRO errors can manifest as drifts
(e.g. the screen on a head mounted display can continue moving even when the device is stationary). Note that 
though the BNO080 can continuously attempt to calibrate the gyroscope for ZRO, it is possible to fool the 
calibration algorithms through slow horizontal rotations (around the gravity vector). Placing the device on a stable 
surface will force the ZRO calibration to converge rapidly. The gyroscope calibration algorithm attempts to remove 
ZRO while the device is not on a very stable surface, for this to be successful the device to which the BNO080 is 
mounted must have sufficient tremor such as the human hand. If there is insufficient tremor it is advisable to 
disable the gyroscope calibration to prevent drift (i.e. by mis-calibrating ZRO). ZRO will always be corrected when 
the device becomes very stable (such as when laid on a table).
3.1.4 Magnetometer
Magnetometers measure the magnetic field around them and the typical use case is to determine the position of 
the Earth’s magnetic North pole. The magnetic field can be distorted by the presence of magnetic fields caused 
by speakers, magnets etc. (hard-iron effects) or other ferrous materials (soft-iron effects). BNO080 can 
dynamically calibrate the readings from the magnetometer to compensate for these distortions. Without calibration 
the heading reported by BNO080 will be highly suspect so it is highly recommended to calibrate the 
magnetometer. For more information on calibrating the magnetometer, see section 3.2.
3.1.5 Calibration Accuracy
The BNO080 provides input reports (see section 1.4.5) to send sensor data to the host microcontroller. The input 
reports include a “Status” field that indicates the accuracy status of the sensor. This is especially useful when the 
application needs to know the calibration status of the BNO080 outputs. Bits 1:0 of the Status field indicate the 
accuracy as shown in Figure 3-1. Refer to the SH-2 Reference Manual [1] for more information.

3.1.6 Recommended Settings
Note that by default the accelerometer and magnetometer calibration are enabled for all interface modes except 
UART-RVC. In UART-RVC mode planar-ZGO calibration is enabled.
For general applications that require motion tracking in a relatively stable magnetic field it is recommended to use 
9-axis sensor fusion outputs (Rotation Vector – see section 2.2.4) from the BNO080. If the device to which the 
BNO080 is attached provides sufficient tremor then the gyroscope calibration can be enabled. However the user 
should verify performance with their specific motion profile.
If the application requires an orientation estimate in an unstable magnetic field, the Game Rotation Vector may be 
more useful.
For virtual reality applications, stability and smoothness of head tracking is important. During application use 
dynamic calibration of the magnetometer can result in undesirable motion artifacts such as jumps as the BNO080 
attempts to compensate for magnetic field distortions. It is therefore recommended to use the Game Rotation 
Vector (see section 2.2.2) or gyro rotation Vector (see section 2.2.6 and 2.2.7 ) and only enable the calibration of 
the accelerometer.
For RVC applications it is generally expected that the UART-RVC mode be used and in this case planar ZGO will 
be enabled by default. If the user has a similar application but requires higher rate outputs then alternate 
interfaces can be used. The planar accelerometer calibration can be enabled by the user. 
3.2 Calibration Steps
For best motion tracking performance, it is recommended to calibrate the BNO080. Since each MEMS sensor part 
has different individual characteristics, each device using the BNO080 must be calibrated individually. 
Figure 3-2 summarizes the steps required to calibrate the accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. For 
more details on the procedure to calibrate the BNO080, refer to the BNO080 Sensor Calibration Procedure 
application note [7]. Note that in normal use the device will be exposed to conditions that will allow calibration to 
occur with no explicit user input. The steps are provided below if a user wants to force a calibration.
Sensor Calibration Procedure
Accelerometer • For 3D calibration the device should be moved into 4-6 unique 
orientation and held in each orientation for about 1 second to 
calibrate the accelerometer
• For planar calibration the device should be rotated around it Z-axis 
by at least 180 degrees
Gyroscope Device should be set down on a stationary surface for approximately 2-3 
seconds to calibrate the gyroscope
Magnetometer Device should be rotated about 180° and back to the beginning position in 
each axis (roll, pitch and yaw). Device should be rotated about 2 seconds on 
each axis.

4 BNO080 Orientation
The BNO080 can be mounted in an arbitrary manner that facilitates the manufacture of the device it is included 
within. The outputs of the BNO080 must however be aligned to a frame of reference that is practical to the user. 
This essentially requires mapping the orientation of the BNO080 to the orientation of the device within which it is 
housed. Re-mapping of the BNO080’s sensor outputs to the supporting device’s frame of reference is achieved 
by programming an FRS record. The system orientation FRS record (0x2D3E) applies a rotation to the sensor 
outputs and all the derived outputs (e.g. rotation vectors). The system orientation record is a unit quaternion, with 
each coordinate represented as a 32-bit fixed point number with a Q-point of 30 to represent a fractional number.
The default BNO080 axis orientation is shown in Figure 4-1. A positive value is reported for counter-clockwise 
rotations.
Figure 4-1: BNO080 axis orientation
If the BNO080 was mounted such that its positive Y-axis was aligned opposite to the X-axis of the device it was 
mounted in, but with its Z-axis aligned correctly, a clockwise rotation of 90˚ around the Z-axis would be required 
(see Figure 4-2).

The highlighted row is also shown pictorially in Figure 4-2. For rotations that are not a multiple of 90 degree 
rotations the appropriate angular rotations should be applied.
4.1.1 Tare
The outputs generated by BNO080 can also be oriented under user control by a tare function. Taring allows a 
user to mount the BNO080 in an arbitrary manner and by invoking the tare command the SH-2 software will 
determine the orientation that needs to be applied to the outputs to align with an Up, North, East frame of 
reference. This orientation will then be applied to all motion outputs. 
If the Rotation Vector or Geomagnetic Rotation Vector is necessary for the application, the BNO080 must have 
resolved magnetic North before applying the tare function. Otherwise when the magnetometer calibrates the 
heading will change.
4.1.1.1 Types of Tare
There are two types of tare defined, tare around all axes and tare around the Z-axis. A tare around all axes solves 
for tilt and heading. A tare around the Z-axis only solves for the heading. In an HMD application, the all-axis tare 
is useful for initial adjustment, further adjustments are likely for heading reasons and then the tare-Z may be more 
applicable.
The result of a tare function is applied wherever power is applied to the device. To ensure the reorientation is 
permanent there is a Persist Tare function to allow storage of the orientation configuration. Note that if tare-Z is 
used for the Game Rotation Vector, then the BNO080 must be reset. At startup, the BNO080 will apply the new 
orientation to the Game Rotation Vector. Persist tare does not apply to the Game Rotation Vector.
Refer to the BNO080 Tare Function Usage Guide application note [8] for more information on how to use tare.

5 Getting Started with BNO080
5.1 BNO080 in UART-RVC mode
When the BNO080 is configured for UART-RVC mode it starts up and sends a string containing the following 
information:
%Hillcrest Labs 10003608
%SW Ver 3.2.x
%(c) 2017 Hillcrest Laboratories, Inc.
This message informs the user that the BNO080 has exited reset and provides version information.
Following this message the BNO080 will issue packets according to 1.3.5.2
5.2 BNO080 in non UART-RVC configurations
The BNO080 starts up with all sensors disabled, waiting for the application processor (AP) to configure it. The 
following sections provide details of typical sequences to enable features on the BNO080.
5.2.1 Establishing Contact
After power up or reset the BNO080 will assert the interrupt (HOST_INTN) indicating that the reset routine has 
completed and that the BNO080 is ready for communication. A read from the BNO080 will return the initial SHTP 
advertisement packet. This packet details the SHTP channel assignments and packet length parameters (see [1] 
and [2]). Following the SHTP advertisement packet, the individual applications built in to the BNO080 will send a 
packet indicating they have left the reset state:
• The executable will issue a reset message on SHTP channel 1
• SH-2 will issue an unsolicited initialization message on SHTP channel 2
Beyond these initial messages the BNO080 will wait for configuration by the host.
5.2.2 Reading/Writing the BNO080
After reset the sensor hub resides in a sleep state waiting for functionality to be enabled. The sensors or functions 
(detailed in section 2) to enable are application dependent. For example setting the accelerometer report for a 
period of 60ms (useful for screen rotation analysis in mobile phones) would be achieved by a Set Feature report 
as shown in Figure 5-1. The report ID for the accelerometer is 0x1 and a period of 60ms (or 60,000 µs) equates to 
a report interval of 0x0000EA60.

Figure 5-1: BNO080 set feature report (accelerometer) including SHTP header
Once set the BNO080 will issue a get feature response report and then provide input reports at the period set in 
the get feature response report. Note that the get feature response may provide a different period than was 
requested due to the supported rates in the underlying physical sensor. The BNO080 will also respond with a Get 
Feature Response if the sensor’s reporting period is changed. The reporting period can change if a sensor is 
turned on/off or if as a result of another sensor being enabled or disabled the sensor’s rate must be modified.
The sensor input report will be preceded by a timebase reference packet. A report including SHTP header will

6 BNO080 Characteristics
This section describes the electrical and performance characteristics of the BNO080. The BNO080 is a custom 
part that Hillcrest provides based upon the Bosch Sensortec BMF055. All of the BNO080 I/O pins meet CMOS 
and TTL requirements.
Note that the electrical and mechanical sections of the specification reported here are reproduced from the Bosch 
Sensortec BMF055 datasheet. The data in this section is reported for convenience, the reader is encouraged to 
consult the BMF055 datasheet [5] to verify all parameters.

6.3 Power Management
The BNO080 has two distinct power supply pins:
• VDD is the main power supply for the internal sensors
• VDDIO is the power supply pin used for the supply of the internal microcontroller and the digital interfaces.
For the switching sequence of power supply VDD and VDDIO, it is mandatory that VDD is powered on and driven to 
the specified level before or at the same time as VDDIO is powered ON. Otherwise there are no limitations on the 
voltage levels of both pins relative to each other, as long as they are used within the specified operating range.
The reader is encouraged to read sections 1 and 3.2 of the BMF055 [5] datasheet for more information.

6.6 Mechanical Characteristics
The sensors within the BNO080 are specified by Bosch Sensortec. The mechanical and electrical details of the 
raw sensors are specified in the BMF055 datasheet [5].
The SH-2 software within the BNO080 configures the accelerometer for a range of +/- 8g and the gyroscope with 
a range of +/- 2000 ˚/s.
6.7 Performance Characteristics
The SH-2 software within the BNO080 calibrates and interprets the raw sensor data received from the gyroscope, 
accelerometer and magnetometer. By fusing the data from all three sensors the BNO080 can provide an estimate 
of the orientation of the device, the applied acceleration (i.e. gravity is removed from the accelerometer signal) 
and an estimate of gravity. Figure 6-12 captures the performance of the BNO080 when using an external clock or 
crystal.

The results above were generated by simulation. 210 physical devices were characterized and each of these 
models was subjected to simulated motion and the variation from truth catalogued. The rotation vector and 
geomagnetic rotation vector are highly dependent on the environmental conditions (specifically the magnetic 
field). In practice the rotation vector is typically accurate to 5˚ and the geomagnetic rotation vector to 10˚.
6.8 Latency
Latency is a measure of the response of the BNO080 to motion and is typically reserved for continuous sensors. 
The time to generate an output can be divided into several parameters:
• Sensor delay
• Processing delay
• Algorithmic delay
• Communication delay
The sensors within the BNO080 will generate an output reflecting motion or a measure of the magnetic field within 
the sample period just measured. The sensor interrupt is assumed to be the end of the sample.
The processing time of the BNO080 is dependent on the output of interest. The output for fused sensors (rotation 
vector, gravity etc.) follows a gyroscope sample and requires additional processing to fuse the gyroscope data 
with the accelerometer and magnetometer data. 
Processing time is measured from data becoming available from the sensor to data being made available to the 
host (HOST_INTN asserted). 
The algorithms present in SH-2 apply BW limiting filtering which in turn adds a small delay to the signal. 
The communication delay is dependent upon the transfer speed of the communication medium chosen and the 
host’s ability to respond to interrupts and support the maximum clock rate of the BNO080.
The measured latency for the BNO080 is provided in Figure 6-13.

6.9 Report Rates
The number of reports per second that the BNO080 can reliably deliver is dependent on the interface bandwidth 
and the processing time within the BNO080 for the generation of the data. The sensors also have discrete sample 
rates which must be taken into account when configuring the device. The BNO080 will attempt to satisfy the 
requested rate based on the following formula:
0.9 * RequestedRate <= ConfiguredRate <= 2.1 * RequestedRate

Note that the AR/VR stabilized versions of the various rotation vectors have the same maximum report rates as 
their non-stabilized version.
6.10 Power Consumption
The power consumption of the BNO080 is dependent on the configuration of the device including the sample 
rates of various sensors and even the environment in which the device is being used. For example an 
environment in which the magnetic field is constantly changing will require additional processing to resolve the 
current heading if a sensor that requires the magnetic field is configured. The table below provides typical power 
consumption numbers for sample configurations using the SPI interface. Measurements are taken with VDDIO at 
3V and VDD at 3.3V.

7.5 Soldering Guidelines
The moisture sensitivity level of the BNO080 sensors corresponds to JEDEC Level 1, see also 
• IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020C "Joint Industry Standard: Moisture/Reflow Sensitivity Classification for non￾hermetic Solid State Surface Mount Devices" 
• IPC/JEDEC J-STD-033A "Joint Industry Standard: Handling, Packing, Shipping and Use of 
Moisture/Reflow Sensitive Surface Mount Devices" 
The sensor fulfils the lead-free soldering requirements of the above-mentioned IPC/JEDEC standard, i.e. reflow 
soldering with a peak temperature up to 260°C.
7.6 Handling Instructions
Micromechanical sensors are designed to sense acceleration with high accuracy even at low amplitudes and 
contain highly sensitive structures inside the sensor element. The MEMS sensor can tolerate mechanical shocks 
up to several thousand g's. However, these limits might be exceeded in conditions with extreme shock loads such 
as e.g. hammer blow on or next to the sensor, dropping of the sensor onto hard surfaces etc. 
We recommend avoiding g-forces beyond the specified limits during transport, handling and mounting of the 
sensors in a defined and qualified installation process. 
This device has built-in protections against high electrostatic discharges or electric fields (e.g. 2kV HBM); 
however, anti-static precautions should be taken as for any other CMOS component. Unless otherwise specified, 
proper operation can only occur when all terminal voltages are kept within the supply voltage range. Unused 
inputs must always be tied to a defined logic voltage level.
For more details on recommended handling, soldering and mounting please contact Hillcrest Labs and ask for the 
“Handling, soldering and mounting instructions” document [6].
7.7 Environmental Safety
The BNO080 sensor meets the requirements of the EC restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS and RoHS2) 
directive, see also: 
• Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on the restriction 
of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. 
7.7.1 Halogen content 
The BNO080 is halogen-free. For more details on the analysis results please contact Hillcrest Labs.
